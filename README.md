# StarterKit
The easiest way to build a Domo [Dev Studio App](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-overview) using [Domo](www.domo.com)'s versatile charting engine, [Phoenix](https://github.com/DomoApps/domo-phoenix). If you are already familiar with building a Custom App with Phoenix, you may want to refer to the [QuickStart](./QuickStart.md) for the minimal steps to get your app running.


### Before you begin
This guide assumes you have already completed the **Dev Studio** [Overview](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-overview) and [Quickstart](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-quickstart) on [developer.domo.com](https://developer.domo.com). *Please complete those before continuing this tutorial*.


### Requirements
Please ensure you have the following installed:

- A Git client - Have an installed [command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) Git client.
- NPM - NPM is included with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) install. Run `npm -v` in our terminal to ensure this is installed.
- ryuu - This is installed when doing the Dev Studio [Overview](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-overview). Run `domo -v` in our terminal to ensure this is installed.




# Download and install StarterKit
Use git to *clone* (download) this project from [https://github.com/DomoApps/StarterKit.git](https://github.com/DomoApps/StarterKit.git). If you are using a command line client, `cd` to the folder you want the `StarterKit` in, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DomoApps/StarterKit.git
```


In a terminal window, change to the `StarterKit` folder and install the project:

```bash
cd StarterKit
npm install
```





# Publish your App

### Find your dataset id
Login to Domo and find the dataset you plan to hook your App up to. To do this:

- Login to Domo.
- Go to the Data Center (located in the top grey bar of Domo).
- Search for the dataset you want to use, then go to the "Details" view by selecting it.
- When viewing the detail of the dataset in Data Center you should see the browser url look something like this:

```
https://mycompany.domo.com/datasources/f3312abc-469b-476e-8283-ef77367c9fec/details/overview
```

- The dataset id is the 36 character hash between the `datasources/` and before `/details`. In the URL above my dataset id is `f3312abc-469b-476e-8283-ef77367c9fec`.
- Copy the dataset id portion in your browser's URL. You will need to paste this in your terminal in the next section.
- While you are here, take note of the column name of two columns you would like to use to chart with later. Ideally one should have numeric values and the other text values.


### Make sure you are up-to-date
Before you can publish your App you will want to make sure that your `domo` client is up to date and linked to the correct instance.

- To link the `domo` client to the correct instance, run the following in your terminal:
 
```bash
domo login
```

- Select the correct "Domo instance" from the list or select "new instance" to add a new one.
- If you choose "new instance" you will be prompted to enter the instance domain. Generally this is your "companyname" followed by `.domo.com`.
- If your `domo` client needs to be updated you will be prompted here. Do it, it doesn't take that long.
- If you are not already logged into that instance, you will be prompted to do so via your web browser.
- Once your instance is set and you are logged in, you are ready to publish to that instance.


### Create your App's manifest
Choose **manifest only** when running the `domo init` command to start the process of initializing your Domo Custom App:

```bash
domo init
```

- Give your App a name.
- Choose **manifest only**.
- Connect to your dataset using the dataset id (type `Y` when prompted).
- Paste your dataset id when prompted.
- Give your dataset an alias, any name (without spaces) will do. You will use this alias later, so don't forget it.
- You do not need to add anymore datasets (type `n` when prompted).


### Modify your App's manifest
The default size in the DomoApp is too small for a Phoenix chart. Open the `manifest.json` (now in your `StarterKit` folder) and change the following:

- Change the `width` from `1` to `3`.
- Change the `height` from `1` to `2`.
- Save and close the file.


### Publish your App
Return to your terminal window and type:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Your Custom App can now be added as a Card to any page in Domo! We will do this in the *Using your Custom App* section.





### Start the server
In your terminal run:

```bash
npm start
```

Check that the server is running by going to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see "Domo StarterKit" if it is running correctly.


### Edit index.html
- Open `index.html` in the `StarterKit` folder in your preferred IDE or text editor.
- Change the HTML in the `body` to "Hello World".
- Go to back to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see that the App changed (`npm start` should still be running).





# Installing Phoenix
Now that you have a running Custom App, lets add Phoenix to it so you can chart data. 

- Return to your terminal window.
- Quit the `npm start` command (if it is still running, press `Ctrl + C` on Windows or `Cmd + C` on Mac).
- Ensure you are still in the `StarterKit` folder, then type:

```bash
npm install --save @domoinc/domo-phoenix
```


### Import Phoenix into your App
Open `index.html` and replace the code inside `<body></body>` with the following:

```html
<div id="phoenix-chart"></div>
```

Note: This `div` is where the Phoenix chart will get placed inside of, as a `canvas` element.


Open `src/index.js` and add the following lines:

```js
const DomoPhoenix = require('@domoinc/domo-phoenix');

function chartIt(chartType, data, options){
    // Create the Phoenix Chart
    const chart = new DomoPhoenix.Chart(chartType, data, options);

    // Append the canvas element to your app
    document.getElementById('phoenix-chart').appendChild(chart.canvas);

    // Render the chart when you're ready for the user to see it
    chart.render();

    return chart;
}

//// Start Sample Chart
const data = {
    // This is the data you get back from the Domo Data API
    rows: [
        ['Low', 'Corporate', 8582.8875],
        ['High', 'Home Office', 14415.941],
        ['Low', 'Consumer', 1264.8215],
        ['Medium', 'Small Business', 21478.799],
        ['Critical', 'Consumer', 2621.97],
        ['Not Specified', 'Consumer', 2211.31],
        ['Critical', 'Corporate', 10087.1315],
        ['Not Specified', 'Corporate', 4407.138],
        ['High', 'Consumer', 11667.366],
        ['High', 'Corporate', 19503.323],
        ['Low', 'Small Business', 1735.3715],
        ['Low', 'Home Office', 10057.42],
        ['Medium', 'Home Office', 7691.02],
        ['Critical', 'Small Business', 4036.064],
        ['Not Specified', 'Small Business', 84.99],
        ['High', 'Small Business', 689.74],
        ['Critical', 'Home Office', 7416.828],
        ['Not Specified', 'Home Office', 1839.26],
        ['Medium', 'Consumer', 4280.034],
        ['Medium', 'Corporate', 7965.238]
    ],
    // You provide the names, types, and mappings of your ordered columns
    columns: [
        {
            type: DomoPhoenix.DATA_TYPE.STRING,
            name: 'Order Priority',
            mapping: DomoPhoenix.MAPPING.SERIES
        },
        {
            type: DomoPhoenix.DATA_TYPE.STRING,
            name: 'Customer Segment',
            mapping: DomoPhoenix.MAPPING.ITEM
        },
        {
            type: DomoPhoenix.DATA_TYPE.DOUBLE,
            name: 'Sales',
            mapping: DomoPhoenix.MAPPING.VALUE
        }
    ]
};

// Set a chart type using the correct enum: https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties
const chartType = DomoPhoenix.CHART_TYPE.BAR;

// Set your "Chart Options": https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/api
const options = {
    width: 660,
    height: 450
};

chartIt(chartType, data, options);
//// End Sample Chart
```


### Test
- Run `npm start` to test the App in your browser 
- Go to back to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you should now see a Phoenix chart





# Using live data
This section is a simple example of how to query data from Domo. Please see the [Data API](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio-references/data-api) documentation for more detail on how to query data in Domo.

### Install domo.js (part of ryuu.js)
Install domo.js so you can query data from Domo, to do this:

- Return to your terminal window.
- Quit the `npm start` command (if it is still running, press `Ctrl + C` on Windows or `Cmd + C` on Mac).
- Ensure you are still in the `StarterKit` folder, then type:

```bash
npm install --save ryuu.js
```


### Add domo.js to your App
Add `const domo = require('ryuu.js');` to the top of `src/index.js`. The top of `index.js` should now look like this:

```js
require('normalize.css/normalize.css');
require('./styles/index.scss');
const DomoPhoenix = require('@domoinc/domo-phoenix');
const domo = require('ryuu.js');
```


### Get the data
Use domo.js to get your data

- In your `src/index.js` file, replace the lines between `// Start Sample Chart` and `// End Sample Chart` with the following:

```js
const datasetAlias = 'DATASET_ALIAS';
domo.get(`/data/v1/${datasetAlias}?limit=100`).then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- Replace `DATASET_ALIAS` from the code above with the alias you gave your dataset while creating the App's manifest. For example if your dataset alias was "sales" that line would look like this:

```js
const datasetAlias = 'sales';
```

### Test
- Run `npm start`.
- Go to back to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
- Open the JavaScript console of your browser (in Chrome this is: `Ctrl + Alt + I` on Windows or `Cmd + Alt + I` on Mac).
- Watch the console tab when you click the refresh button in your browser.
- You should see a JavaScript object logged with the first 100 rows of your dataset.




### Query columns and chart the result
Replace the `domo.get` line we just put in your `src/index.js` file with the following:

```js
const columns = [
    {
        type: DomoPhoenix.DATA_TYPE.STRING,
        name: 'COLUMN_1_NAME',
        mapping: DomoPhoenix.MAPPING.ITEM
    },
    {
        type: DomoPhoenix.DATA_TYPE.DOUBLE,
        name: 'COLUMN_2_NAME',
        mapping: DomoPhoenix.MAPPING.VALUE
    }
];


// Get and chart the data
let myChart = null;
getData(datasetAlias, columns).catch(displayError).then((data) => {
    if(data){
        // Set a chart type using the correct enum: https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties
        const chartType = DomoPhoenix.CHART_TYPE.BAR;

        // Set your "Chart Options": https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/api
        const options = {
            width: 660,
            height: 450
        };

        const phoenixData = { columns: columns, rows: data };
        myChart = chartIt(chartType, phoenixData, options);
    }
});
```

- Replace `COLUMN_1_NAME` from the code above with the column name from your dataset containing text values.
- Replace `COLUMN_2_NAME` from the code above with the column name from your dataset containing numeric values.


### Test
- Run `npm start` in your terminal (if is it not already running).
- Go to back to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


### Keep the chart up to date
If your data is truly dynamic then you will want to make sure your App is always showing the most recent data. You can do this by making another request to get the most recent data and update your chart with that result. To do this on a 15 second interval for example you would add:

```js
const interval = 15000; //15 seconds
setInterval(() => {
    if(myChart && myChart.update){
        getData(datasetAlias, columns).catch(displayError).then((data) => {
            data && myChart.update({ columns: columns, rows: data });
        });
    }
}, interval);
```


### Test
Your chart should now get refreshed with the most recent data every 15 seconds, to verify this:

- Run `npm start` in your terminal (if is it not already running).
- Go to back to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
- Open the network tab of your browser (in Chrome this is: `Ctrl + Alt + I` on Windows or `Cmd + Alt + I` on Mac, then select the "Network" tab at the top of the opened panel).
- You should see a new request being added to the list every 15 seconds.





# Publish and test your App
Now that domo.js is added, you can test that it is querying your dataset correctly. Before you can test it you will need to build and publish your App again. If you don't remember how to do this, it is as simple as running `npm run deploy`:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Using your Custom App
To use your Custom App, add it as a Card to one of your pages in Domo. To do this:

- Login to Domo.
- Find or create a Page you want to add the Custom App's Card to.
- Select "Design" from the Page's "Add Card" dropdown.
- In the popup modal select "Custom App"
- You should be taken to a screen of your published Apps. Select the Custom App you just published.
- Click the "New Card" button in the popup modal.
- You should be taken to a preview of your App, from here you will select a dataset to power up the App.
- Below the grey preview area there is a black bar with the dataset alias you setup for you App, select it.
- Open the "Select Dataset" dropdown.
- Search for the dataset you would like to use and select it.
- You should now see a preview of the dataset to the right under "Data Preview"
- If this looks correct, click the "Save & Finish" button in the top right above the App's grey preview area.
- You should be redirected to your Page with the Custom App added as a Card to the Page.





# How to use Phoenix
Now that you have Phoenix added to graph your data, let's go over how it works. First we will look at this line:

```js
const chart = new DomoPhoenix.Chart(chartType, data, options);
```

Creating a new chart via `new DomoPhoenix.Chart()` requires the following parameters:

1. Chart Type - [Choose a chart type](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/charts) that will best visualize your data
2. Data - A two dimensional Array of the data
3. Options - Set the "Chart Properties" your Chart Type supports. A full list of properties can be found, per Chart Type, on the [Chart Specific Information](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties) page of the documentation.


### Choose your Chart Type
- The Chart Type is set using an `enum`. You can find the `enum` for your Chart Type by selecting the Chart Type on the [Chart Specific Information](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties) page of the documentation.
- Examples of using these charts are found on the [Charts](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/charts) page of the documentation.


### Formatting your data for Phoenix
Phoenix expects data in the following format:

```js
const data = {
    rows: [
        ['Corporate', 8582.8875, 'Low'],
        ['Home Office', 14415.941, 'High'],
        ['Corporate', 7965.238, 'Medium']
    ],
    columns: [
        {
            type: DATA_TYPE.STRING,
            name: 'Customer Segment',
            mapping: MAPPING.ITEM
        },
        {
            type: DATA_TYPE.DOUBLE,
            name: 'Sales',
            mapping: MAPPING.VALUE
        },
        {
            type: DATA_TYPE.STRING,
            name: 'Order Priority',
            mapping: MAPPING.SERIES
        }
    ]
};
```

Where:

- `rows` is a 2 dimensional `Array` of the data.
- `columns` is an `Array` of `Objects` describing how to chart each column (or Array index) in the `rows` Array. For instance, in the example above the value of the first index/column of my row data is "Corporate", so my `Object` for that column is:
    - `type` - The value is a `string` so I use `DATA_TYPE.STRING` here (see the **Data Types** section of [Phoenix API](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/api) for the full list of types).
    - `name` - The value came from the "Customer Segment" column of my dataset, so that is how I want Phoenix to label it.
    - `mapping` - Mappings vary by Chart Type (see the **Column Information** for your Chart Type on the [Chart Specific Information](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties) page of the documentation). I am using a [bar chart](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/chart/bar) so the supported mappings for my chart are `ITEM`,`VALUE` and `SERIES`. For a bar chart: 
        - `ITEM` is graphed on the x axis.
        - `VALUE` is graphed on the y axis.
        - `SERIES` defines the segments of the bar chart making this a stacked bar chart.
        - See the **Column Information** for each Chart Type on the [Chart Specific Information](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties) for a complete list of mappings.


### Set the Chart Options
Chart options are used to customize how your chart is displayed. More on using this can be found in the [Phoenix API](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/api) documentation. For now you can just set the `height` and `width` and ignore the rest. These values are pixel dimensions for the chart.

```js
const options = {
    width: 600,
    height: 500
};
```

Note: A full list of the `properties` your Chart Type supports can be found on the [Chart Specific Information](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/properties) page of the documentation.


### Place the canvas on your page
Once you know the `chartType` you want, have the `data`, and have set the `options` you are ready to create a Phoenix `Chart`. Now just place the `canvas` element on your page and call the `.render()` method to tell Phoenix you are ready for it to draw your chart:

```js
// Create the chart
const chart = new DomoPhoenix.Chart(chartType, data, options);

// Append the canvas element to your app
document.getElementById('phoenix-chart').appendChild(chart.canvas);
 
// Render the chart when you're ready for the user to see it
chart.render();
```

More about `render()` and other methods supported by `Chart` can be found on the **Chart Methods** section of the [Phoenix API](https://domoapps.github.io/domo-phoenix/#/domo-phoenix/api) documentation.
